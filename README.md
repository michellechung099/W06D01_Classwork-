Make our list elements in the nav menu into inline-block elements.
By default a tags are inline and cannot have any padding applied to them. First, change their display property to correct this default behavior. Then give the links in those list elements a padding on all sides of 20px
Pick the correct display property to position the nav next to the logo.
Set our main content region by giving the body a width of 900px.
Use the classic centering trick margin: 0 auto to center the body.
Give the main section a 700px width and the aside a width of 180px.
Apply a display property to position the aside and section next to each other. Space them out with a 15px margin-right on the aside.
If you find your ingredients list aligned to the bottom use the developer tools to find and correct the styling.
Space out the list elements in the ingredients list with a top and bottom margin of 15px.
Space out the directions the same way.
Use the display property to put input elements on their own row. At this point it probably looks better to remove the "Cooking Expertise" and "Rating" labels.
Space out the select element with margin and assign widths to the text input, select, and textarea to finish up our form.
Challenge: There is a reason we only gave the aside a margin-right of 15px when it should have been 20px to constitute the full 900px of the body. To see what I am talking about, jump into the DevTools, check off the margin-right on the aside, and apply a border-left 1px solid black on the aside and a border-left 1px solid black on the section. Why is there still a space between the borders? Research why and test some corrections.

When you're finished, compare your website to the solution.

CSS Reset
Download this skeleton. Work out of css_reset.css.

Oh no! We've removed the original reset stylesheet! Time to build our own.

Create a file called custom_reset.css.
Clear default margin, padding and border from any elements that we're using in our HTML.
Make sure font properties get inherited.
Remove default styling from lists.
Give text in the body a line-height of 1.5.
Make sure images always take up the width of their parents.
CSS Float
In this section, we will be updating our navbar to use the float property and create a basic fluid grid system for our main content. Let us begin. üôè

Instead of making the nav into an inline-block element, use float to put our nav in the top-right.
Just for fun, float the logo to the left and then clear-fix the vertical collapse problem.
Replace the fixed pixel widths of our aside and main content section with a fluid grid system similar to those seen in the CSS Grid System video. Create a css file calledcustom_grid.css and add these changes to that file. Note that this will require updating index.html with respective container class names.
You may need to give your recipe image a width of 100% so it expands to fit the entire figure and does not default to its natural fixed pixel width. Do this for all images by applying it to custom_reset.css.
CSS Flex
In this section, we will be converting the work from the previous section from using floats to using flexbox.

First, let's remove the clearfix class from our header as it won't play well with flex.
Next, we should unfloat our logo image and our nav, and remove the inline-block display property from the list items in our nav.
Now that we've undone our beautiful styling, we can call flex to our aid! Let's add display: flex to our header and see what happens.
Our logo and nav links should be side-by-side now since they're both children of our header. Now figure out which element needs display: flex for our individual nav links to appear side-by-side.
The last thing we need is more space between our logo and our nav links. Give our header justify-content: space-between so that it arranges its children just the way we want.
